**A computer is a device that performs logical operations and data processing, can use input and output devices to display information, and usually includes a central processing unit (CPU) to perform operations. If there is no central processing unit, then the device must function as a "client gateway" to a computer server that acts as a computing processing unit.**

Monitor - a device for operational visual communication between the user and the control device and displaying data transmitted from the keyboard, mouse or central processor.

RAM  - in most cases, a volatile part of a computer memory system, in which, during computer operation, executable machine code (programs) is stored, as well as input, output and intermediate data processed processor. Random access memory (RAM) is a technical device that implements the functions of random access memory. RAM can be manufactured as a separate external module or located on the same chip with the processor, for example, in single-chip computers or single-chip microcontrollers.

Motherboard  is a printed circuit board, which is the structure of a modular device, for example, a computer.

The built-in computer power supply is a device designed to convert AC voltage from the mains into DC voltage in order to power a computer or server computer.

Cooler - when applied to computer topics - the Russian name for an assembly of a fan with a radiator, installed for air cooling of computer electronic components with increased heat dissipation (usually more than 5 W): central and graphic processors, chipset microcircuits.

An optical disc drive (also a CD drive, CD drive) is an electromechanical device for reading and (in most modern models) recording, by means of a laser, information from optical discs in the form of a plastic disc with a hole in the center (CD, DVD and etc).

Solid State Drive (SSD) is a newer technology. There are no moving parts here: information is recorded on NAND (Negative-AND) memory chips. The more chips, the more disk capacity.

Hard disk drive, or HDD (English hard (magnetic) disk drive, HDD, HMDD), hard disk, collapsible. A hard drive is a random access storage device based on the principle of magnetic recording. It is the main storage medium in most computers.

Video card (also video adapter, video card, graphics adapter, graphics card, graphics card, graphics accelerator) is a device that converts a graphic image stored as the contents of a computer's memory (or the adapter itself) into a form suitable for further display on the monitor screen. Typically, a video card is made in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) and is inserted into the expansion slot of the motherboard, universal or specialized

A computer mouse is a coordinate device for controlling the cursor and issuing various commands to the computer.


A computer keyboard is a device that allows the user to enter information into a computer (input device).
