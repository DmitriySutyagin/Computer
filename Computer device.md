RAM  - in most cases, a volatile part of a computer memory system, in which, during computer operation, executable machine code (programs) is stored, as well as input, output and intermediate data processed processor. Random access memory (RAM) is a technical device that implements the functions of random access memory. RAM can be manufactured as a separate external module or located on the same chip with the processor, for example, in single-chip computers or single-chip microcontrollers.
